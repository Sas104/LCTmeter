Tried to implement the following tutorial with arduino interface.

This setup works for inductance measuring but could't measure capacitance in my case. 
The frequency increases rather than decreasing for some unknown error.
However, the rc charging and discharging technique works well for measuring capacitance.
So if you use it, my suggession is use this technique just to  measure the inductance not capacitance.
